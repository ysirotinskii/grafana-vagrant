#A scrape_config section specifies a set of targets and parameters describing how to scrape them. In the general case, one scrape configuration specifies a single job. In advanced configurations, this may change.
#Targets may be statically configured via the static_configs parameter or dynamically discovered using one of the supported service-discovery mechanisms.
#Additionally, relabel_configs allow advanced modifications to any target and its labels before scraping.

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape.
